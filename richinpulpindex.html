      <p class="post-title">KEVIN FEIGE SOLIDIFIES HIS BASE</p>
      <body>Kim Masters, writing in <a href=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/marvel-shake-up-film-chief-819205>The Hollywood Reporter</a>,

      <blockquote class="blockquote">The shift also evidences the tricky executive politics that Iger must manage as a result of assembling several freestanding feifdoms under the Disney banner over the past decade. Pixar Animation Studios, Lucasfilm and Marvel have been key acquisitions that brought with them valuable intellectual property assets and creative expertise. But each silo is overseen by powerful executives such as animation gurus John Lasseter and Ed Catmull, producer Kathleen Kennedy and Perlmutter and Feige, respectively, all of whom have tremendous influence within their corner of the Disney empire.</blockquote>
      <p> I'm consistently impressed by the job Iger has done, though this fiefdoms approach might turn dangerous if one acrues too much success.</p><br>
